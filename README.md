___

## STRUCTURE

___

### Home Page

As nearly all webpages consist of, we have a title with a subtle animation of the first character that is interactive by slightly shrinking in size on hover devices.

Next, we have a navigation bar with our tabs centered on all device sizes. These two elements will be consistent in all our pages, along with the social links and copyright information, two of which will be explained below.

Further down, we'll find an image that sets the peace of mind of the clients visiting the page, by showing a healthy workplace, which everyone should strive for.

After that, we can find a paragraph explaining what the company was created for, what methodology is used by them and what recent legislations they comply on.

And of course in the end we have our social links which are also centered and some copyright information at the very bottom.

### Services Page

Keeping things simple with our services page, there is a lot of information to be put out there regarding the services this company provides, but what better way is there than to encourage our clients for a one on one explanation of their needs?

### Contact Page

Contact info on this page is made interactive by linking the e-mail and phone numbers so they're one click/tap away from getting in touch without needing to copy and paste around.
