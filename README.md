# ROCK PRIVACY SOLUTIONS

___

## Project Portfolio 1

### RPS is a website designed to raise awareness for smaller businesses of data privacy, and also provide services to them.

___

## STRUCTURE

The website is consisted of 3 pages. On the home page there is information of what this company does and why it's so good at what it does. On the services page there are titles of the services they provide. On the contact page there is all information to get in touch with them.

### Home Page

As nearly all webpages consist of, we have a title with a subtle animation of the first character that is interactive by slightly shrinking in size on hover devices.

Next, we have a navigation bar with our tabs centered on all device sizes. These two elements will be consistent in all our pages, along with the social links and copyright information, two of which will be explained below.

Further down, we'll find an image that sets the peace of mind of the clients visiting the page, by showing a healthy workplace, which everyone should strive for.

After that, we can find a paragraph explaining what the company was created for, what methodology is used by them and what recent legislations they comply on.

And of course in the end we have our social links which are also centered and some copyright information at the very bottom.

### Services Page

Keeping things simple, there is a lot of information to be put out there regarding the services this company provides, but what better way is there than to encourage our clients for a one-on-one explanation of their needs?

### Contact Page

Contact info on this page is made interactive by linking the e-mail and phone numbers so they're one click/tap away from getting in touch without needing to copy and paste around.



## My thoughts on this project

The idea for this project originated from my good friend who runs her own GDPR oriented and service providing company. The main goal of the website is to attract new clients by giving them the best knowledge in this field by very high standards.

I started very plain and simple: _pen and paper_.

First, i sketched the home page. The original sketch was somehow different than the version there is on the website now, but the core elements are there.
From then on i had the idea in my head and went straight over on gitpod to start my HTML. 

And then for the fun part (and frustrating at times), __CSS__.

While there were a lot of new concepts I learned from the course, there were a ton more I learned from the CSS god [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob). I relied on that for most of the issues i was having with layout and picked up a few animations tricks along the way, which make the website look good on load. 

The biggest concern i had was making it mobile friendly and flex-box takes good care of that for different elements.

I really enjoyed the CSS part because you can do so much with it.
