## RPS is a website designed to raise awareness for smaller businesses of data privacy, and also provide services to them.

**Building rock solid foundations in privacy & data protection.**
Rock Privacy Solutions was built with the intention of introducing smaller businesses to the concept of data privacy, advise them on how to approach these situations in strategic ways and also make sure to provide these needed services to them. 

The idea for this project originated from my good friend who runs her own GDPR oriented and service providing company. The main goal of the website is to attract new clients by giving them the best knowledge in this field by very high standards.


# Features
* Navigation Bar
    * Present in all three different pages of this website, the navbar is fully responsive to appear at the center of the screen in all different monitors and devices. It shows what page the user is on by highlighting the active page and it's easy to navigate.

* Services Section
    * The two most important services that this company provides are shown in the form of isometric illustrations and a short paragraph describing each one, in the form of a <code> &lt;details&gt;</code> element. The user can just click/tap over the top of the image on the service they're interested in and its description will reveal.

* Contact Page
    * This page is very inviting to the users by offering them to send a message via the contact form, or if they want a more personal choice of a phone call or e-mail there's buttons that takes them straight to the respective option they want to choose.

# Testing

All the files in this project succeeded in passing the required tests.

The website is fully responsive and works just as intended on different screen sizes.

# Validator Testing
* HTML
    * No errors were returned when passing through the validator
* CSS
    * No errors were found when passing through the validator

# Unfixed Bugs

The one thing that wasn't resolved was the footer bar not always sitting at the bottom on bigger screen sizes. I didn't take full advantage of CSS features at the time of coding.

# Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. It was very easy to do and from the time of deployment to the live view of the site didn't take long at all.
